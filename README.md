# Posture-detection-using-PoseNet-ML
This git repo shows  how to use PoseNet to identify and analyze different body postures. This will enhance our understanding of this powerful tool for human pose estimation.

## Overview
This project leverages the power of PoseNet, a machine learning model, to detect and analyze human body postures in real-time using a webcam. The PoseNet model provides a robust solution for identifying key body points and skeleton structure, which can be used for various applications including fitness tracking, gesture control, and more.

## Introduction
PoseNet is a vision-based neural network that estimates the pose of a person in an image or video. By using PoseNet, we can identify the positions of key body parts such as the nose, eyes, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. This project showcases a real-time demonstration of PoseNet using the ml5.js library and p5.js for visualization.
