# Posture-detection-using-PoseNet-ML
This git repo shows  how to use PoseNet to identify and analyze different body postures. This will enhance our understanding of this powerful tool for human pose estimation.

## Overview
This project leverages the power of PoseNet, a machine learning model, to detect and analyze human body postures in real-time using a webcam. The PoseNet model provides a robust solution for identifying key body points and skeleton structure, which can be used for various applications including fitness tracking, gesture control, and more.

## Introduction
PoseNet is a vision-based neural network that estimates the pose of a person in an image or video. By using PoseNet, we can identify the positions of key body parts such as the nose, eyes, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles. This project showcases a real-time demonstration of PoseNet using the ml5.js library and p5.js for visualization.

## Language and Libraries
HTML: Provides the structure of the webpage.
JavaScript: Implements the core functionality of PoseNet using the ml5.js library.
ml5.js: A friendly high-level interface to TensorFlow.js, providing simple machine learning models.
p5.js: A library for creating visualizations and interactive content.

## Features
The model uses the Posenet model to detect human pose in real-time from a webcam. The model uses the keypoints detected by the Posenet to draw skeleton lines on the human pose. The model overlays images of spectacles and smoke on the nose keypoint.

## Advantages
Real-time Detection: Capable of detecting body postures in real-time using a webcam.
Ease of Use: ml5.js provides a simple interface for integrating PoseNet.
Versatility: Can be adapted for various applications like fitness apps, gaming, and interactive installations.

## Disadvantages
Performance: Real-time processing might be slow on lower-end devices.
Accuracy: The accuracy of pose detection can be affected by poor lighting or occlusions.
Dependency on External Libraries: Requires internet access to load ml5.js and p5.js.

## Scope
Fitness Tracking: Monitor and analyze exercises and body postures.
Rehabilitation: Assist in physical therapy by tracking patients' movements.
Interactive Games: Develop motion-controlled games.
Human-Computer Interaction: Create gesture-based control systems.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the capabilities of PoseNet for real-time posture detection and analysis. By utilizing machine learning models like PoseNet, we can develop applications that require accurate human pose estimation. The integration with ml5.js and p5.js makes it accessible and easy to implement, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements and use cases.
